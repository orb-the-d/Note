Purpose
I built this repo to organize my own CEH study process and to help others preparing for the exam.
All notes reflect personal understanding and are for educational use only.

Broke the CEH curriculum into clear sections, using resources from the official syllabus, video courses, and labs.

Summarized essential information for exam review and practical work.

Annotated commands and tool examples based on lab experience.
